Arp-arduino-ableton-fsr
=======================

This is a code using the MIDI.h library from the arduino website, to interface between analog input to midi.
I'm using this to make a touch sensitive keyboard with an primitive arpeggiator. The software can currently 
run 4 inputs (i'm using fsr-sensors) with a for-loop which is causing the arp. There should not be any problems
with expanding the code and add more sensors. I'm using Ableton Live to handle the midi-input.
